# @agilecontent/eslint-config

Base configuration for eslint, used internally by @agilecontent

## How to use

Add this repository as a dev dependency, alongside eslint:

```shell
npm i -D eslint @agilecontent/eslint-config@github:agilecontent/eslint-config
```

Extend this config in your project's. Example with .eslintrc.js:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    //...other extended config
    '@agilecontent/eslint-config',
  ],
  rules: {
    //Add you own rules here
  },
};
```

**IMPORTANT:** This config includes `eslint-config-prettier`, so it is very important to put this as
the **last** extended config

## Rule reasoning

### @agilecontent/eslint-config

- `arrow-body-style`: if the only expression in an arrow function is a `return`, the function should
  not have braces
- `no-duplicate-imports`: prevents the imports to become a mess
- `curly`: adds curly braces to single statement conditionals and loops to prevent prettier to make
  them single line

### @agilecontent/eslint-config/frontend

Everything in base config, plus:

- Extends `plugin:react/recommended` with recommended rules
- Extends `plugin:react-hooks/recommended` with rules for react hooks
- `react/prefer-stateless-function`: if a react class component only has a `render()`, it should be
  a function component
- `react/jsx-fragments`: makes explicit the use of react fragment, instead of the `<></>` syntax, as
  the short syntax does not support attributes (i.e. `key=`)
- `react/self-closing-comp`: empty components should be self closing (i.e. `<div/>` instead of
  `<div></div>`)

### @agilecontent/eslint-config/backend

Everything in base config, plus:

- `env.browser` set to false
